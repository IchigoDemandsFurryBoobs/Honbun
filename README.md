**本文 (Honbun)** is a visual novel engine built ontop of the excellent [LÖVE framework](https://love2d.org/).

It's desgined to be as simple as possible so anyone can jump in and use it, even without programming knowledge, while still allowing a great amount of control/flexibility for those who want to take it to the next level.

# Features
- **Simple** and to the point; all you need is a text editor and a copy of LÖVE.
  - **Characters/Costumes** which only take one line to setup! Everything else is handled automatically, behind the scenes.
  - **Anchors!** Just specify what side of the screen characters, etc. are supposed to show up on (e.g. "left", "right", or "center"); Honbun takes care of the rest!
    - Alternatively, you can specify the X/Y coordinates manually if you want more control.
  - **Built-in Save State support** allows you to save/load current player state with just one line!
- **Completely open-sourced** and under the [MIT License](LICENSE.txt)!
- **Cross-platform!** Write your game once, then play it on **Windows** (Vista+), **macOS** (10.7+)\*, **Linux**, **Android** (6.0+), and **iOS**\*\* without having to change a single line; the controls and user-interface automatically adapt for each!
- **Flexible!** Honbun was designed specifically to give you control, with features such as:
  - **Built-in Animation Editor** for creating custom movement you can then make your game play back with ease!
  - **Triggers** for ensuring things happen right on-cue!
  - **States** for custom menus, events, UI elements, etc.
  - **Custom UserData** that automatically gets saved/loaded along with everything else.
